# To-Do-List-App
In this task I used html, css and javascript programming language.

My task was to create a small program that can:
1. Add tasks
2. Delete tasks
3. Edit tasks
4. Save data when reloading the page
5. Distinguish between completed and uncompleted tasks

From these points, I was able to fully implement adding, removing, and the difference between completed and not completed tasks.

I implemented the addition of elements through input, that is, we enter some values in a special field, then press the add button and after that, we get the result.
Also, when adding a task, I made it so that after each addition, our input field remained clean, so that it did not have to be erased every time.

I implemented the deletion of elements in two ways. I made a delete button that removes the first item from our task list.
And the second way is to add a special cross to each of our tasks so that you can delete a certain task.

I implemented the distinction between completed and uncompleted tasks by adding a special gray checkmark to each task, which we can click on and it will turn green, which tells us that the task has been completed.

Point 4 was partially completed, on the screen, when the page is reloaded or closed and reopened, everything disappears, but if you look in the browser console itself, then all the data is stored there.

When I click the delete button, the data is also deleted and no longer stored in the browser.

Unfortunately, I could not implement the editing of elements.
But the idea was that when clicking on a certain task, display the value of this task through the index of this task in the input field, and then when we change the input field, press the edit button, which will give us the new value of the task.

Thank you for taking the time to read my explanation file. Have a good day.
